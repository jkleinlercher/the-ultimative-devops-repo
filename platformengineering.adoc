platform engineering

platform engineering is a popular devops discipline where modern platforms are designed and implemented to host applications.
modern platforms usually have the following capabilities:

- fully api-driven so that platform services can be instantiated and consumed by its platform users
- scalability and high-availability features allow applications to scale and recover from failures
